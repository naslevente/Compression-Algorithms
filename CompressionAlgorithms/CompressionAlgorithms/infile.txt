Promoting market-rate housing will only result in the construction of more luxury apartments, not more affordable housing for those that really need it. Many believe encouraging market-rate housing will result in more houses for the poor. According to Amee Chew, however, this is false. She writes “for-profit new construction is overwhelmingly geared toward the luxury market.” But it’s lower-income households who face the most severe affordable housing shortfalls. Since 1990, while our high-end stock has steadily grown, on balance we’ve lost over 2.5 million affordable units renting for under $800.” This is because, as Michael Hobbes of the Huffington Post states, high construction costs and extremely expensive lands make construction very costly. As a result of all these expenses, Hobbes claims, “developers can only make a profit on high-end apartments.” Additionally, California’s Legislative Analyst’s Office found that luxury housing typically only drops in price by 0.3% each year, meaning that after 30 years, rent would only be 9% lower. For someone near the poverty line, a luxury apartment could take more than a century to become affordable. Even worse, David Alpert, the founder of urban planning group GGWashington, writes that market-rate housing incentivizes owners of depreciated buildings to renovate them into luxury apartments, which fuels more returns. Unfortunately, these deteriorated apartments are accompanied by lower income households, who are displaced by this renovation. Clearly, market-rate housing doesn’t provide affordable housing for all, but rather only for those who could already afford housing in the first place.
